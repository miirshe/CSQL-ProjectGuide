# C# with SQL Database - Project Guidance

## Overview

Welcome to the project guidance session where we'll take you from **scratch to production** using **C#** and **SQL Database**. This guide will help you set up your environment, understand coding concepts, work with databases, and build a functional application. By the end of this session, you'll have a project in C# with an integrated SQL database ready to be deployed.

## Agenda

### 1. Introduction

  - **Frontend** (optional): Overview if applicable.

### 4. C# Fundamentals
- **Basic Concepts**: Data types, loops, conditionals, and OOP principles.
- **Project Setup**: 
  - How to create a C# project.
  - Writing basic classes and methods.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.

### 5. SQL Fundamentals
- **Database Design**: Table creation, primary/foreign keys, normalization.
- **Basic SQL Queries**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **Stored Procedures**: Creating and executing stored procedures.

### 6. C# & SQL Integration
- **Entity Framework Core**: Setup and use of EF Core for data access.
- **Database Connections**: Writing C# code to connect and interact with SQL databases.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from the database.

### 7. Building the Project
- **Step-by-Step Project Guide**:
  - Define the project architecture.
  - Create the database and tables.
  - Implement business logic in C#.
  - Connect your app to the SQL database using Entity Framework.
  - Write code to perform CRUD operations.
- **Testing**: How to test your C# code and database integration.

### 8. Best Practices
- **Version Control**: Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for tracking changes.
- **Code Cleanliness**: Writing maintainable and readable code.
- **Security**: Basic best practices for handling database connections securely.
- **Performance**: Optimizing SQL queries and database structure.

### 9. Deployment
- **SQL Server Deployment**: How to deploy your SQL database.
- **Application Hosting**: Basics of deploying the C# application locally or on the cloud.
- **Final Testing**: Ensuring everything works before the final handover.

### 10. Q&A Session
- Discuss common challenges and how to resolve them.
- Open floor for questions and feedback.
